The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the BlueNet web application development, moving from zero to a significant MVP. Initially, the engineer focused on building out the core frontend and backend structure based on the detailed product requirements, including the landing page, authentication, dashboard, and placeholder AI features. Key achievements included integrating RAG for the AI Assistant, setting up the backend API, and implementing basic UI components with Shadcn.

However, after an initial declaration of complete implementation (Message 143), implicit user feedback or internal validation revealed critical flaws. The engineer then correctly identified and prioritized fixing inaccurate Mandi Recommendation logic, improper Hugging Face model integration for fish forecasting, and a non-functional Mapbox implementation. The current work revolves around systematically addressing these critical issues, particularly rectifying the Mapbox integration with  and configuring the API key, and updating the related frontend components. The engineer was about to restart services and test these fixes when the trajectory ended.

<product_requirements>
The BlueNet project aims to develop a professional, clean, and minimal web application for local fishermen and policymakers in India, focusing on AI-powered fishing assistance. Key features include: a responsive landing page with Fish Smarter. Stay Safer. Earn More. tagline, multilingual support, and login/register options. A role-based dashboard for Fishermen includes AI Fish Forecasting (using GPS, 4 Hugging Face models for environmental signals, and Mapbox for heatmaps/recommendations), Fish Market Price Prediction (using provided ML code and dataset to recommend best mandis), Catch Compliance, Disaster & Safety Alerts (with geofencing), Community Communication, AI Assistant (RAG pipeline with , , , , and user's Gemini API key), and a Start Journey feature to track live location, calculate fuel consumption (with custom efficiency input), and integrate geofencing. The Policymaker Dashboard provides compliance stats, risk zones, and sustainability insights. The design emphasizes ocean-themed colors (white/neutral/blue/teal), rounded UI cards, Shadcn UI components, responsive design, and an offline-first UX. All backend API calls must use the  prefix via FastAPI and MongoDB.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in fixing critical implementation issues that arose after an initial completion claim. The primary focus was on rectifying the Mapbox integration for interactive maps, ensuring the correct use of  and the provided Mapbox API key. This involved modifying  to properly render the map and markers, and updating  and  to utilize this  with the Mapbox token. The engineer also aimed to address inaccuracies in the Mandi Recommendation and Hugging Face model integrations, starting with data replacement and model logic fixes in the backend. The last recorded action was the intent to restart services and test these recently applied fixes, indicating the map integration was the immediate, unfinished task.
